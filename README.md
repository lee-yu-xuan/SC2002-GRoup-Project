MOBLIMA is an application to computerize the processes of making online booking and purchase of movie tickets, listing of movies and sale reporting. It will be used by the moviegoers and cinema staff.

# Setup
We use VSCode to implement our project. Feel free to use other IDE, but VSCode is the best way to review our project.

We use OpenCSV for the CRUD operation to the CSV file.

To setup the VSCode for OpenCSV:
1. Open our project in VSCode
2. Goto the reference library, select opencsv.jar from the lib file
3. You are good to go!
